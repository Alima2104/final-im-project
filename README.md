# no-more-stress
The interactive project with serial communication between Arduino and Processing. 

It's the project that helps to cope with stress. Stress is one of the most common problems people face in their daily lives, and as a student before final exams, I realize it especially strongly.

This time it won’t be a game but a way to create a work of art while releasing the stress. The algorithm of creating an art piece was the following:

1) Choose the word that causes your stress. It could be just “stress,” “assignment,” “Calculus” or I would’ve written “C++” last semester. Write it, and it will appear on the screen.
2) Now the most fascinating part begins: you will hit this word! Obviously, not the word itself, but the latex stretched over the frame. Behind it, there will be a distance sensor to understand where you hit this time and display your actions on the screen.
3) Each hit will be seen as a spot in a certain color and a certain place. It will be possible to change the color of the spots by pressing the buttons on the Arduino, as well as the intensity of the applied color with a potentiometer.
Also, there will be a nice song to hit the word that causes your stress with even more satisfaction.
4) Colored spots are made using generative art to make each piece even more unique.
The process of hitting will probably help to reduce the stress, and the result like the unique artwork will help to elevate the mood.
